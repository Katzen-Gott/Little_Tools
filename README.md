Small scripts for different purposes

File writer copies files from one dir to another one by one, with 5sec pause. I needed this to make music flash-cards for my car player.
File writer works with directories recursvely, but sorts them with files altogether (e.g. if you have files a.jpg and c.jpg and a folder b, this all will be copied in following order: a.jpg, b with all its content, c.jpg) This might be fixed later.
There might be some issues with file-name encoding, I had all files shown as "?????" on player after using the script on mac.
